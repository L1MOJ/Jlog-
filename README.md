## Summary and reflection
It was the first time I completed a big assignment like full-stack development independently, and I learned and contacted many new knowledge points through classes and online search, and got a deeper understanding and knowledge of web development, front-end, back-end, database and other concepts and technologies, and also mastered certain development ability. In the process of doing so, I also encountered many problems and difficulties, most of which were solved through online search, and learned the basic architecture of front-end and back-end projects, from the original confused and overwhelmed to gradually understand the structure. Mastered the use of back-end interface debugging tools, mockjs simulation of back-end data, Swagger design interface to make development more clear integration. After watching a lot of online courses on database operations, I decided to continue learning mybatisplus and use it to write statements on sql operations, which also greatly simplified my operations. I also learned a lot of concepts like DI, IOC, VO, and encapsulation during the learning process, which was very rewarding.It's a very primitive version with a lot unfinished works and bugs maybe, I will try to perfect it in the future.
